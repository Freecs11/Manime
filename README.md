Hi everyone , this is a little project to practice java spring + angular all while building something fun ;

Here the app idea : a manga/anime 'task' manager , that allows you to add a certain anime episode / manga to your list with different option ,
main one is to specify a time limit to finish it and when it gets close to the time ( -2 days ) and you haven't finished it then the app will 
send frequent reminders  ( would be great if i can make this for mobile so that it annoys you more xd ) .
